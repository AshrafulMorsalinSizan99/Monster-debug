<h3>Question: What are the differences between local storage and session storage?</h3>
<p>Ans: <br> i.Local Storage is a web storage method that helps us store data on the client’s computer in the form of
    key/value pairs in a web browser wheareas the sessionStorage is very similar to the localStorage. Still, the main
    difference lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current tab or session is on. Once you close
    the tab or terminate the session, the data on session storage also gets lost. </p>
<p>ii.As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.But session storage is
    session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e.,
    until the browser (or tab) is closed</p>
<p>iii.The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB whereas the storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</p>
<p>iv.There are fewer old browsers that support it</p>
<h3>Question: What are the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
<p>Ans: <br>
</p>
<p>i. The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global
    scope.Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
    inside the curly brackets {}.</p>
<p>ii.Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional
    state can access that variable whaereas in block scope, the variables can be accessed in fixed part of the program.

<h3>Question: How does javascript event loop work?</h3>
<p>Ans: The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
    empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively
    runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
<h3>Question: How do we find the error undefined?</h3>
<p>Ans: A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined
    if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was
    not returned. </p>
<p>We can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators to determine whether a variable has a value</p>
